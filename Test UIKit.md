## For whom?
For developers who started developing iOS for the first time and use UIKit, we created it so that you can easily and comfortably experience objects.

---
## Why should I use the app?
You can use the app to experience UIKit's objects, get to know their code, and understand how they work.

---
## How is it different from other apps?
There are a few other apps related to UIKit, but what makes our app different is that it shows simple code and saves you the trouble of finding the code you need to use when you create code using xcode.
